Method is essential, and enables a larger amount of work to be got
through with satisfaction. "Method," said Cecil (afterward Lord
Burleigh), "is like packing things in a box; a good packer will get
in half as much again as a bad one." Cecil's despatch of business
was extraordinary; his maxim being, "The shortest way to do many
things is to do only one thing at once." 
-- Samuel Smiles
