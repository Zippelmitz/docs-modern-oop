It is dangerous to make predictions, especially in a discipline that
changes so rapidly, but one thing I can say with confidence is that
I have seen the future, and it is object-oriented.
-- Grady Booch

The most important concept in object-oriented programming is naturally
the object.

Objects are synonymous with objects in the real world. Think of any
object and think of how it looks and how it is measured and interacted
with. When creating OOP languages, the reasoning was that if it mimics
the thought process of humans, it would simplify the coding experience.

For example, let's consider a chair, and its dimensions, weight,
colour and what is it made out of. In object-oriented Perl, these values
are called M<Attributes>. These are values that define the object's
identity and state.
